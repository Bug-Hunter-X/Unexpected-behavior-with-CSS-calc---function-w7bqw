The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly in combination with other CSS units, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors. For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` in a width property might work as expected, but `calc(100% - 50%)` can lead to unexpected results because the second term is a percentage of the element's own width which is being calculated. This creates a circular dependency. Also, mixing different units inconsistently within a `calc()` expression can sometimes lead to the entire expression being ignored.
